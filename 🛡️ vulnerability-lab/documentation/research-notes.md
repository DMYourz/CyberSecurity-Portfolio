## Lab Architecture Design

### Environment Setup
1. **Host System**: Ubuntu 22.04 (current sandbox)
2. **Wazuh SIEM**: All-in-one installation on host
3. **Vulnerable Target**: Metasploitable2 VM or containerized equivalent
4. **Scanner**: Nessus Essentials on host system

### Network Configuration
- Host system: Primary interface
- Vulnerable target: Accessible via network
- SIEM monitoring: All network traffic and scan results

### Integration Points
1. Nessus scan results → Wazuh SIEM
2. Network monitoring → Wazuh alerts
3. Vulnerability correlation → Risk assessment
4. Automated alerting → Incident response

## Lab Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1. Install Wazuh SIEM on host system
2. Deploy Metasploitable2 target (VM or container)
3. Install and configure Nessus Essentials
4. Verify network connectivity

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning
1. Configure Nessus scan policies
2. Execute comprehensive vulnerability scan
3. Analyze scan results and findings
4. Export results for SIEM integration

### Phase 3: SIEM Integration
1. Configure Wazuh to ingest Nessus results
2. Create custom rules for vulnerability alerts
3. Set up dashboards and visualizations
4. Test alerting mechanisms

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. Screenshot key steps and results
2. Document findings and analysis
3. Create professional report
4. Develop recommendations

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive vulnerability assessment report
- SIEM integration demonstrating centralized monitoring
- Custom detection rules for vulnerability management
- Professional documentation suitable for portfolio

## Skills Demonstrated
- Vulnerability scanning and assessment
- SIEM deployment and configuration
- Log integration and correlation
- Risk prioritization and reporting
- Security tool integration
