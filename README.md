# CyberSecurity Portfolio

Hey there! I'm Dan, a cybersecurity analyst who believes the best way to learn security is to break things (in a lab, of course).

This portfolio is a collection of hands-on projects where I've built, configured, analyzed, and occasionally troubleshot my way through various security tools and scenarios. No fluff, just real technical work.

## SIEM & Security Operations

### [Splunk Security Operations Lab](./SIEM-Projects/splunk-security-lab/)
My second Splunk lab - built a full SIEM environment from scratch. Collected 350,000+ security events, configured forwarders, and learned why firewall rules matter the hard way.

**Tech:** Splunk Enterprise, Universal Forwarder, VirtualBox, Windows 11, Kali Linux

### [Splunk Log Analysis & Threat Detection](./SIEM-Projects/Splunk_Log_Analysis_Threat_Detection/)
First dive into Splunk. Analyzed the BOTS v3 dataset, investigated a Cerber ransomware attack, and wrote way too many SPL queries.

**Tech:** Splunk, SPL, BOTS Dataset, Incident Response

## Network Security

### [Nmap Network Scanning Automation](./Network-Security/Nmap_Network_Scanning_Automation/)
Automated network scanning scripts. Why click when you can script?

**Tech:** Nmap, Python/Bash, Network Discovery

### [Vulnerability Lab](./Network-Security/vulnerability-lab/)
Vulnerability scanning and SIEM integration. Because finding vulnerabilities is only half the battle - you need to monitor them too.

**Tech:** Vulnerability Scanning, SIEM Integration

## Cryptography

### [Cryptography Toolkit](./Cryptography/Cryptography_Toolkit/)
Playing with encryption, hashing, and cryptographic algorithms. The math is hard, but the implementations are fun.

**Tech:** Cryptography, Python, Encryption Algorithms

### [Digital Signatures](./Cryptography/Digital_Signatures/)
Understanding and implementing digital signatures. Trust, but verify.

**Tech:** PKI, Digital Signatures, Cryptographic Verification

## Security Research

### [Educational Keylogger Project](./Research/Educational%20Keylogger%20Project.pdf)
An educational project exploring how keyloggers work. Built for learning, not for evil.

**Tech:** Python, Security Research, Ethical Hacking

## What I'm About

I'm a hands-on learner. I don't just read about security tools - I install them, break them, fix them, and document the whole process. This portfolio isn't polished marketing material; it's real work from someone who's constantly learning and building.

If you're into practical cybersecurity, SIEM analysis, threat detection, or just enjoy seeing someone figure things out through trial and error, you're in the right place.
